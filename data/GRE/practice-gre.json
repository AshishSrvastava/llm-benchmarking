                "more difficult in the 1680s, so Behn tried various",
                "other types of prose genres in the hope of finding",
                "another lucrative medium. In fact, a long epistolary",
                "scandal novel that she wrote in the mid-1680s sold",
                "quite well. Yet, as Carnell notes, Behn did not repeat",

                "nature of tragedy. As prescribed by Dryden, tragedy",
