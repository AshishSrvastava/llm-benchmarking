                "more difficult in the 1680s, so Behn tried various",
                "other types of prose genres in the hope of finding",
                "another lucrative medium. In fact, a long epistolary",
                "scandal novel that she wrote in the mid-1680s sold",
                "quite well. Yet, as Carnell notes, Behn did not repeat",
                "this approach in her other prose works; instead, she",

                "though only about half of these were published during",
                "her lifetime. Carnell argues that Behn, whose stage",
                "productions are primarily comedies, may have turned",
                "to an emerging literary form, the novel, in a conscious",

                "the politically oriented dramatic tragedies of her day.",
                "However, Carnell argues that Behn took issue with",
                "the way in which these writers and plays defined the",
                "nature of tragedy. As prescribed by Dryden, tragedy",

                "otherwise heroic figures commit in the domestic",

                "questioned the view promulgated by monarchist",
                "dramatic tragedies such as Dryden's: that the",
                "envisioned \"public\" political ideal–passive",

                "in the private sphere, with family members wholly",
                "obedient to a male head of household. Carnell sees",
