    "narratives. According to literary critic\n",

    "primarily motivated by financial considerations: \n",
    "earning a living by writing for the theatre became \n",
    "more difficult in the 1680s, so Behn tried various \n",
    "other types of prose genres in the hope of finding \n",
    "10 | another lucrative medium. In fact, a long epistolary \n",
    "scandal novel that she wrote in the mid-1680s sold \n",
    "quite well. Yet, as Carnell notes, Behn did not repeat\n",
    "this approach in her other prose works; instead, she \n",
    "turned to writing shorter, more serious novels, even \n",
    "15 | though only about half of these were published during \n",

    "However, Carnell argues that Behn took issue with \n",
    "the way in which these writers and plays defined the \n",
    "30 | nature of tragedy. As prescribed by Dryden, tragedy \n",
    "was supposed to concern a heroic man who is a public \n",

    "sphere. Moreover, according to Carnell, Behn \n",
    "40 | questioned the view promulgated by monarchist \n",
    "dramatic tragedies such as Dryden's: that the \n",
